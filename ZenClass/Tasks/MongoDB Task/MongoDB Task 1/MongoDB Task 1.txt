db.products.aggregate([{$group:{_id: "$product_price", count:{$sum:1}}},{$match:{count:{$gt:1}}}, {$project:{count:0}}, { $out: { db: "test", coll: "temp_price_delete" } }])


// Delete the documents with duplicate price entries from the main products collection

db.products.deleteMany({product_price:{$in:db.temp_price_delete.distinct("_id")}})
